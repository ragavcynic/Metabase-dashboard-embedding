Project Title: Secure Metabase Dashboard Integration with User-Specific Views in HTML Template

Description:

This project entails embedding Metabase dashboards into a custom HTML template while implementing a user authentication system. Users will have access to different dashboards based on their roles and permissions, which are defined using data provided in seeds.js. The integration involves generating JWT tokens with a 10-minute expiration time to securely access the dashboards and display them within the HTML template.

Key Components and Steps:

Metabase Integration:

Configure Metabase dashboards according to the data visualization requirements.
Obtain a Metabase security key (API key) to access the dashboard data.
JWT Generation and Authentication:

Implement user authentication using data provided in seeds.js to authenticate users.
Develop a mechanism to generate JWT tokens for authenticated users with a 10-minute expiration time.
Utilize the JWT tokens to securely access the appropriate Metabase dashboards based on user roles and permissions.
Dashboard URL Retrieval:

Authenticate users and authorize access to specific dashboards based on their roles and permissions.
Fetch the iframe URLs for the authorized dashboards using Metabase's API endpoints.
HTML Template Integration:

Design a custom HTML template with a login system to authenticate users.
Implement dynamic rendering of Metabase dashboards within the HTML template based on user authentication and authorization.
Embed the retrieved dashboard iframe URLs into the HTML template dynamically.
Security and Access Control:

Ensure secure handling of user authentication data and JWT token generation.
Implement proper error handling and validation to prevent unauthorized access to dashboards.
User Interface Customization:

Customize the appearance and layout of the HTML template to seamlessly integrate the embedded dashboards.
Implement responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
Testing and Deployment:

Thoroughly test the integration to ensure proper functionality, security, and responsiveness.
Deploy the integrated HTML template with the embedded Metabase dashboards to the desired hosting environment.
Benefits:

Provides a secure and user-specific approach to embedding Metabase dashboards into custom HTML templates.
Offers different views and access levels to users based on their roles and permissions.
Enhances data visualization capabilities by leveraging Metabase dashboards within a controlled environment.
Facilitates seamless integration with existing web applications or portals, enhancing overall user experience and data accessibility.
Conclusion:

Integrating Metabase dashboards into HTML templates with user-specific views and authentication adds a layer of security and customization to data visualization solutions. By following the outlined steps and considerations, this project aims to deliver a robust and user-centric integration that meets the diverse needs of different users accessing Metabase dashboards within a web environment.
