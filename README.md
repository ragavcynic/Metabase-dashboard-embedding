# Metabase-dashboard-embedding
The goal of this project is to seamlessly integrate a Metabase dashboard into a custom HTML template. This integration involves utilizing Metabase's security features to securely access the dashboard data, generate a JWT token with a limited expiration time, and fetch the dashboard's iframe URL for embedding it into the HTML template.
